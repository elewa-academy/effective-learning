# Manage Your Mindset

Given the right opportunities and environment, humans learn. [It's just what we do](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-natural-human-tendency-andrew-johnson/).  We can't help it!

But it can be very easy to get in your own way.  Especially when you're learning something inherently challenging like software development.  To maximize your learning it helps to keep a healthy mindset.  

From our experience successful students:

1. Have a Growth Mindset:

  * [Programming & Growth Mindset](https://www.digitaladventures.com/news/2016/5/2/how-learning-to-code-can-help-develop-a-growth-mindset)

2. Live in the Learning Zone:

  * [Balancing the Two](http://jonathanreeve.com.au/blog/2017/10/13/balancing-learning-and-performance)

3. Embracing Confusion:
  * [Good & Bad Confusion](https://theconversation.com/confused-dont-worry-because-that-can-be-a-good-thing-64421)
  * [Necessary to Learning](https://quantumprogress.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/embracing-confusion-as-a-necessary-part-of-learning-part-1/)
  * [Uncertainty is Inevitable](https://towardsmaturity.org/2017/04/12/learning-uncertainty-cope/)
 
Using these three mindsets is a skill.  They often don't come naturally but with practice you can learn to apply them effectively to every challenge you will face.  When you feel like you can't keep them up any longer push through!  Your ability to maintain these perspectives will grow the longer you try.
