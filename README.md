# Study Journal

Of all the skills you will need as a developer __effective learning__ is the most important.  There is no library, no framework, no buzzword you can master that will serve you better than strong study and learning habits.  

Fortunately studying and learning are skills you can improve.  Keeping an organized study journal is the first step.

In this project you will learn a way of organizing and hosting your notes that allows you to easily access them by date or by topic.  Along the way you will learn how to work on git/GitHub, how to build and deploy a project, create a complete GitHub repository, and the difference between source code & runtime code. Committing yourself to maintaining your notes repository will enable you learn how to manage a growing code-base without the added complexity of dealing with real code.  

As your notes grow, and as your understanding changes, you will find yourself having to do more frequent and more challenging _refactors_.  This is the exact same growing pains you will experience with a real software development project. 

So teach yourself how to learn, how to code, and how to manage source code. It'll be a little tedious right now but your future self will thank you.

## Specifications

1. __GitHub Study Jounral:__
    * Fork this [Template Notes Repository](https://github.com/elewa-academy/study-journal-template), clone it, feature it on your portfolio. Use a GitHub supported theme to make it super cool.
    * Main Repository:
	    * Keeps track of your progress over time.  We recommend you have a folder for each week, a files for each day that week, and one week summary README.md in each week's folder.
    * Gh-Pages & Gitbook:
	    * Categorize & re-categorize what you learn as you learn it. Write one markdown for each important concept you encounter, this file will links to the relevant days' notes. Every time you add to a concept's markdown, you will also modify or add to that concept's quiz.  Revise and re-analyze your notes like this on a daily basis.
2. __Peer Assessments__:
    * Take some time each day to answer each other's Study Journal quizzes.  Check your own knowledge & learn from your classmates.  
    * Give feedback (in person, as an issue, or as a pull request).  If a classmate made a mistake or didn't understand a topic let them know and explain how to improve.  
    * If they wrote a very good quiz you can't figure out, ask them to help you work through it.

Challenges:
* Try writing and editing your notes from command line instead of your text editor using [Nano](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/). The work-flow is very smooth and you'll be forcing yourself to practice using the command line on a daily basis.  (Nano comes pre-installed on Linux & Macs).
* Search your notes with _regular expressions_. As you continue to learn, your notes will continue to grow.  Have no fear!  If you can describe what you're looking for, regex will find it.
